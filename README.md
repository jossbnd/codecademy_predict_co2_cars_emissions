# predict_co2_cars_emissions

Project scope
The project has been made in the scope of my training at Codecademy.com.

This is final project of the Data Science Career Path. The subject is left up to the trainee.
I choose a dataset from French Data governments under an open license.

Data: https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/emissions-de-co2-et-de-polluants-des-vehicules-commercialises-en-france/
License: https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Licence_Ouverte.pdf

This data contains the following informations for all commercialized vehicles in France in 2014:

fuel consumption
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions
emissions of air pollutants (regulated under the Euro standard)
all the technical characteristics of the vehicles (ranges, brands, models, CNIT number, type of energy, etc.)
